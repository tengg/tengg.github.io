In this article, I will summarize the topics on graph theory and algorithms.

In a nutshell, the topics on graph data structure include: traversal, connectivity, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, topology sorting.

### Graph Traversal

DFS, BFS. Too boring to elaborate.

### Connectivity

A typical description for this type of problem is finding the number of components in an undirected graph.

> Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Union-find and path compression is the most used algorithm to solve this problem.

### Shortest Path

This topic can be categorized into several sub-topics: directed edges vs undirected edges; weighted edges vs unweighted edges.

BFS for unweightededges.
Dijkstra for weighted edges.
Floyd for weighted edges, but time complexity is O(n^3).

### Minimum Spanning Tree

Prim:

```
T <- spanning tree
S <- any node
Q <- minQueue for all neighbor of S
while T not complete:
	n = Q.heappop
	T.add(n)
	for all n.neighbors:
		if not in T:
			Q.heappush

```

### Topology Sorting

Topology sort of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv, u comes before v in the ordering.

DFS vs BFS (Kahn's algorithm)

>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Kahan's Algorithm:

```
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edges
while S is non-empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to tail of L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S
if graph has edges then
    return error (graph has at least one cycle)
else
    return L (a topologically sorted order)
```
