## Who am I?
I'm a professional software engineer. I like everything about network, programming and hacking. I built this site to keep track on things that I actually took time to research on. 

Python is my favorite tool. I'll be using Python3 for algorithms demonstration or any techniques that requires scripting.

## How is this site built?
There are two parts. The dynamic site (with backend) are hosted on [Digital Ocean (affiliate link)](https://m.do.co/c/53921fec6121). I also host a number of other applications on it. Their IaaS is fantastic.

The static part of this site is built based on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The codes are stored as a Github repository and automatically presented as pages.

## What if you agree or disagree on what I posted, or want to contact me?
Upper-right corner on every page in this site: email me.
